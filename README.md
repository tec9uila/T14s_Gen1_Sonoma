# T14s_Gen1_Sonoma
My EFI drive/files for booting T14s GEN1 Mackintosh(macOS Sonoma) wrapped into an archive for anyone to make their own hackintosh. MAKE SURE TO CHANGE YOUR SMBIOS OR YOUR HACKINTOSH WILL BE UNABLE TO USE iSERVICES!
(I.E. iMessage, iCloud Drive, Facetime, etc.)
Please feel free to use this EFI folder as a Bootable Installation Medium for macOS 14 Sonoma, however please make sure to change the SMBIOS inside the Config.plist in \EFI\OC\
